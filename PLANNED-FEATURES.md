# GoreeCloud Health — Planned Features

> **Authority:** Repository-native planned-feature record  
> **Migration:** Replaces the retired `FEATURE-ROADMAP.md` / Google Drive roadmap controls. GitHub is the sole feature-state authority.

**Lifecycle:** Active planned work. Planned items remain implementation obligations until verified or explicitly dispositioned in authoritative GoreeCloud records.

## Foundation — repository and product shell

Status: **In progress**

- Establish governed repository structure and mandatory documentation.
- Establish responsive web foundation.
- Establish native Android Compose foundation.
- Establish exact current Stable GLAZE UI V1.3 consumer-adoption path and repository-local acceptance evidence.
- Establish official GoreeCloud Health branding/icon through the canonical branding-assets repository.
- Add reproducible Android Gradle wrapper/build validation.
- Add web and Android automated accessibility/regression checks.

## Phase 1 — trusted local health data

Status: **In progress**

- **Implemented:** canonical `goreecloud.health.record.v1` envelope, source/provenance schema, synthetic validation foundation, and machine-readable fail-closed `goreecloud.health.reconciliation-policy.v1`.
- **Implemented source contracts:** `activity.steps`, `activity.distance`, `activity.active-energy`, `exercise.session`, `sleep.session`, `heart.rate`, `body.weight`, and `hydration.water`, including canonical source-level units where applicable. `activity.active-energy` is a bounded positive-duration interval measurement in `kcal` that excludes basal energy; the current `exercise.session` payload remains deliberately empty pending governed classification/detail semantics.
- **Implemented reconciliation boundary:** trustworthy same-source `(source_id, source_record_id)` re-observation is recognized; records lacking source-native identity are not heuristically deduplicated; cross-source value/time deduplication, aggregation, and conflict resolution remain explicitly unauthorized; replacements require explicit supersession.
- **Implemented privacy source boundary:** Privacy Shield Application Privacy Manifest v1 with exact GoreeCloud Health identity and deliberately empty `purposes`/`resources`, plus fail-closed repository validation. This source declaration grants no health-data processing authority and is not runtime acceptance.
- Expand type-specific normalized contracts for exercise classification/details beyond the bounded session contract, active time beyond the active-energy contract, sleep stages, additional vitals, additional body measurements, broader nutrition, and supported wellbeing records.
- Govern positive domain-specific reconciliation and aggregation rules only where a supported use case requires combining or preferring records across sources; the current machine-readable policy must remain fail-closed until those rules are separately approved.
- Define and govern non-empty Privacy Shield health-data purposes/resources only for implemented operations, then implement operation-level consent, minimization, retention, export, deletion, revocation, derived-use boundaries, and runtime-specific acceptance.
- Integrate Android Health Connect with least-privilege, user-visible permissions only after the applicable Privacy Shield boundary is accepted.
- Read supported activity, exercise, sleep, heart, and body measurements locally.
- Add local encrypted persistence appropriate to the accepted platform security/privacy model.
- Implement data-source management and permission revocation flows.
- Add manual entry only for supported user-authored records.

## Phase 2 — daily experience and wellness domains

Status: **Planned**

- Today summary and customizable health cards.
- Activity, workouts, sleep, heart, body, nutrition, hydration, and mindfulness areas.
- Goals and streaks with transparent calculation rules.
- Trends across day/week/month/year windows.
- Accessible data visualizations and non-visual equivalents.
- Search/filter across supported health records.
- Reminders and notifications with explicit user control.

## Phase 3 — account and synchronization

Status: **Planned**

- GoreeCloud Identity authentication, authorization, device, and session integration.
- Health API with explicit scopes, purpose limitation, and source provenance.
- End-to-end synchronization model with conflict resolution and offline support.
- Privacy Shield runtime authorization for each server-side data use.
- Wardveil security controls and evidence without overstating protection.
- Everkeep backup, restore, export, portability, and recovery verification.
- Minimized GoreeCloud Mesh coordination where justified.
- GoreeCloud Manager health/service status appropriate to its authority.

## Phase 4 — insights and ecosystem expansion

Status: **Planned**

- Personal summaries and explainable wellness insights.
- User-controlled coaching/planning features with clear medical-safety boundaries.
- Wearable/device integrations where authoritative APIs and permissions allow.
- Import/export formats and migration tooling.
- Optional sharing workflows with granular scopes, expiration, revocation, and auditability.
- Additional GoreeCloud form factors after Android/web acceptance.

## Release gates

No production/Stable claim until the supported platform set has verified current implementation, Privacy Shield, Wardveil Security, Everkeep, current Stable GLAZE UI consumer acceptance, accessibility, recovery, security/privacy, and exact-revision release evidence as applicable.
